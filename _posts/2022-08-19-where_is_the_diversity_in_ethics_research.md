# Where is the diversity in ethics research?


I have been interested in ethical and philosophical questions for some time now. The field of ethics is huge and expands in every possible direction and question that we could address, like the relationship of humans to other humans, to other life forms, in the now or in the future, AI superintelligence etc. But what I am confused about, is that it seems that the development of research in ethics, especially in AI ethics focuses currently by the majority on one single issue: the impact of bias in computational models and algorithms on a specific set of groups, where these groups are almost solely defined by their skin color or gender. 

Research on bias in AI addresses the question of how bias in data collection and transformation process may lead to predictions that show lower accuracy for certain groups, such as the very popular projects of [Joy Boulamwini and Timnit Gebru on face detection]( https://www.media.mit.edu/people/joyab/overview/) or [crime prediction algorithms]( https://www.technologyreview.com/2020/07/17/1005396/predictive-policing-algorithms-racist-dismantled-machine-learning-bias-criminal-justice/), or the [Amazon algorithm that was alleged to discriminate on gender]( https://www.reuters.com/article/us-amazon-com-jobs-automation-insight-idUSKCN1MK08G). 

Research on biases in models may help us understand decision patterns and be a very effective and good tool to get a better understanding of our world, I do not understand, why is there so much (at least medieval) focus only on this particular topic?

There are many, many more risks and concerns that arise in relation to the development and application of AI. For example the Ethics Research paper by among others Timnit Gebru and Emily M. Bender (which still remains undisclosed, but you find an article about its contents [here]( https://www.technologyreview.com/2020/12/04/1013294/google-ai-ethics-research-paper-forced-out-timnit-gebru/)) outlines a number of different ethical concerns in relation to Googles language models. It criticizes the CO2 footprint and energy consumption of large models, a reduced explainability and interpretability due to the size of datasets, and risks that these models could be used for manipulative or criminal actions. 

Even more, you can find other topics that deserve more attention. Why? Because we may be at the edge of a new revolution. A group of researchers predicted in 2017 that with a 50% chance AI will exceed human capabilities in most jobs [by 2060]( https://80000hours.org/podcast/episodes/katja-grace-forecasting-technology/). They also predicted that, if this happens, it may lead with a 5% chance to a catastrophic outcome, and updated it recently even to [10%]( https://80000hours.org/problem-profiles/positively-shaping-artificial-intelligence/).

So, while eliminating racial or gender bias from hiring models may serve the benefit of some groups, far more research needs to be put into serving challenges that put humanity as a whole at risk. If computational intelligence advances in mathematical, biological, or physics research fields, there will be questions of far greater ethical complexity that need to be answered. For example, if algorithms help us to decrypt and edit DNA in humans, it may not only lead to the cure of diseases or the extinction of some human attributes (imagine, with a simple procedure one just could change your skin color to black or white, or female, or revert your age) but even to the development of a new human species (imagine, one just could double his IQ in an in a simple procedure). 

Even more, if AI outrules humans in intelligence and is incentivized by misaligned goals, it may lead to an ultimate extinction of humankind, see an example and more detailed info [here]( https://80000hours.org/problem-profiles/positively-shaping-artificial-intelligence/). 
Speaking for my side, I argue that more diversity needs to be introduced in ethics research (or at least the coverage by mainstream media), but diversity in my case does not refer to the gender and skin color of the researchers but addresses the topics and ideas of researchers. Otherwise, you will not achieve diversity, but just shift your focus from one main research topic to another.
