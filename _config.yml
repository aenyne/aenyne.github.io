title: The Very Hungry Datapillar - a Blog about Data Ethics
description: In the light of the moon, a little app lay on a leaf. |
One Sunday morning, the warm sun came up and pop! â€“ out of the app came a tiny and very hungry datapillar. |
He started to look for some food. |
On Monday he ate through one like. But he was still hungry. |
On Tuesday, he ate through two reviews, but he was still hungry. |
On Wednesday, he ate through three pictures, but he was still hungry. |
On Thursday, he ate through four shopping carts, but he was still hungry. |
On Friday, he ate through five social media profiles, but he was still hungry. |
On Saturday he ate through views, movenment recording, network connections, friend's posts, health app reports, face marks, emotional replies, fitness trackers, credit reviews, doctor's accounts. That night he had a stomachache! |
 |
Now, it is Sunday again. |
Let's find one nice green leaf for our datapillar, so he can feel much better, and... |
beome a beautiful butterfly.
