# About
<div>
I am a Freelance Consultant on Data, Analytics and AI topics. Coming from a business background, I learned programming through self-education and online courses. I started learning python for data analysis around 2 years ago.
With this blog, I am following now my love to think about ethics and philosophical topics and put them in the context of data and AI.

<div>In my leisure time, I like to read about technological developments and reflect on how they will shape our future. After I found out that the topic of machine intelligence is one of the [highly neglected risk areas](https://80000hours.org/problem-profiles/artificial-intelligence/) , I have intensified my readings recently, and I want to share some of the yet less common spread topics, that gave me interesting insights and considerations.
