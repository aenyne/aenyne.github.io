I am a Freelance Consultant on Data, Analytics and AI topics. Coming from a business background, I learned programming through self-education and online courses. I started learning python for data analysis around 2 years ago.
With this blog, I am following now my love to think about ethics and philosophical topics and put them in the context of data and AI.
